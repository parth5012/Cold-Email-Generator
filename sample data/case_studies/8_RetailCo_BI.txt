Case Study 8: Data-Driven BI Transformation for RetailCo

Client Industry: Retail / Omnichannel
--------------------------------------------------
RetailCo managed multiple sales channels but lacked unified data visibility. Each team had different KPIs, and reports took up to 24 hours to generate.

Solution Implemented:
We consolidated data pipelines into a centralized warehouse using Snowflake and orchestrated ETL workflows with Apache Airflow. Dashboards were built in Looker, and a semantic layer ensured consistent KPIs across departments. Data governance frameworks were established for long-term scalability.

Business Impact:
- Report generation time reduced from 24 hours â†’ 15 minutes
- Data-driven promotions boosted ROI by 18%
- Report preparation time for analysts reduced by 72%
