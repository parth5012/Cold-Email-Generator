Case Study 6: Predictive Maintenance for MetroManu Industries

Client Industry: Manufacturing / Industrial IoT
--------------------------------------------------
MetroManu Industries suffered frequent machine breakdowns, resulting in unplanned production halts. Maintenance was reactive rather than predictive, leading to high operational costs.

Solution Implemented:
We deployed IoT sensors to monitor machine parameters, streaming data through MQTT into Apache Kafka. Time-series data was stored in InfluxDB, and predictive LSTM models were trained to forecast potential failures. Dashboards built in Grafana provided real-time visibility for operators.

Business Impact:
- Unplanned downtime reduced by 47%
- Maintenance costs dropped by 28%
- Production throughput increased by 11%
- ROI achieved within 8 months of deployment
