Case Study 3: Cloud Migration & Optimization for FinServ Bank

Client Industry: Banking & Financial Services
--------------------------------------------------
FinServ Bank operated several internal applications on aging on-prem servers that caused frequent downtimes and high maintenance costs. The IT team struggled with scalability and lacked automated deployment pipelines.

Solution Implemented:
We migrated 12 applications to AWS using a combination of EC2 and EKS for container orchestration. The databases were migrated to RDS, and Terraform was used for Infrastructure as Code. CI/CD pipelines were set up via GitHub Actions, along with centralized logging (ELK stack) and real-time monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana).

Business Impact:
- Infrastructure costs reduced by 38% in the first year
- Deployment time reduced by 85% (from days to under an hour)
- System availability increased to 99.98%
- Incident detection time reduced by 70%
