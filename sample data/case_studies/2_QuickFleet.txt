Case Study 2: Real-Time Delivery Tracking App for QuickFleet

Client Industry: Logistics / Last-Mile Delivery
--------------------------------------------------
QuickFleet, a logistics startup managing same-day deliveries, needed a mobile platform that could optimize driver routes and give customers live visibility of their parcels. Their previous setup relied heavily on manual updates and phone-based coordination.

Solution Implemented:
Our team built native mobile apps using React Native with real-time location streaming via WebSockets. We integrated Mapbox APIs for optimized routing and AWS Lambda + DynamoDB for a serverless, scalable backend. Offline support ensured uninterrupted delivery updates in low-connectivity zones.

Business Impact:
- On-time deliveries improved by 18%
- Driver idle time reduced by 35%
- Delivery status queries dropped by 48%
- Average delivery cycle time reduced by 12%
