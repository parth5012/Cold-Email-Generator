Subject: Following up on my request for a meeting with [PROSPECT COMPANY]

Hi [FIRST NAME],

I wanted to follow up on my last email regarding a quick chat about how [SELLER COMPANY] could support [PROSPECT COMPANY] in achieving [SPECIFIC GOAL OR ACHIEVEMENT].

If you’re available, I’d love to connect. Please let me know if one of the times I suggested works for you — or, feel free to propose a time that’s a better fit for your schedule.

Thanks, and I look forward to hearing from you!
