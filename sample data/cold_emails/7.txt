Subject: Congrats on [ACHIEVEMENT OR EVENT]!

Hi [FIRST NAME],

I saw [PROSPECT COMPANY] recently [ACHIEVEMENT OR EVENT]. Congrats! [INCLUDE 1-2 SENTENCES ON SPECIFIC PRESS COVERAGE; OFFER SINCERE CONGRATULATIONS AND HOW IT MADE YOU FEEL.]

After [ACHIEVEMENT OR EVENT], many companies find that they need to focus on [YOUR PRODUCT OR SERVICE]. Things are probably busy right now at [PROSPECT COMPANY], but Iâ€™d love to share how we can help [MAIN BENEFIT OF YOUR PRODUCT OR SERVICE].

Do you have time to chat next week? Would [PROPOSE TWO TIME OPTIONS] work for you? If not, please just let me know what time is most convenient.

Congrats again,
